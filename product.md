## Learning Journey Story: Human-like, Voice-first Visual Teaching

Goal: Make the visual learning experience feel like a real teacher — clear, stepwise, interactive, and continuously visualized.

Scenario: “Teach me English grammar.”

1) Warm-up and intent
- Agent briefly frames the topic: what is “English” and what is “grammar”.
- As it speaks, it places 1–2 key terms on the canvas (e.g., “English”, “Grammar”), connected with a simple arrow.
- It asks: “Would you like to focus on English as a language, or on grammar?”

2) Learner choice and focus
- Learner selects “Grammar”. The agent zooms toward the “Grammar” region and highlights it.
- The agent speaks the core definition (short and clear) while adding a concise text box: “Grammar = rules for structure and meaning”.
- Minimal visual noise; only what is currently being explained is added.

3) High-level map
- The agent places a high-level node: “Parts of Speech”. Draws a parent node “Grammar” → child node “Parts of Speech”.
- It asks for readiness: “Shall we explore parts of speech?”

4) Step-by-step exploration
- On “Yes”, it adds subnodes: “Noun”, “Pronoun”, “Verb”, “Adjective”, “Adverb”, “Preposition”, “Conjunction”, “Interjection”.
- It speaks about one at a time (e.g., “Noun”) and adds a short definition directly on the canvas under the “Noun” node.
- The agent avoids dumping all content at once: it appends incrementally, synchronized with speech.

5) Continuous, append-only drawing
- The canvas never resets or replaces existing content. Each step appends new elements only.
- The viewport remains stable, auto-fit only initially; zooms only when focusing a subtopic.

6) Checkpoints and interjections
- At the end of a subtopic, the agent asks a quick check question or offers to continue.
- The learner can interject with questions anytime; the agent pauses listening while speaking to avoid echo, then resumes.

7) Expanding depth on demand
- If the learner asks for examples, the agent adds example bullets near the current node and speaks them.
- Connections (arrows) show relationships (e.g., modifiers, agreement), reinforcing the explanation.

Principles
- Speak and draw in parallel: voice streaming with incremental, sentence-level audio; drawing updates append-only.
- Spatial clarity: smart placement avoids overlap and uses consistent spacing.
- Simplicity: minimal UI, focus on clarity, and continuous context in one canvas.

## Development Notes

### Performance Considerations
- Canvas state sync happens on every change (could be optimized)
- WebSocket broadcasts to all clients (could add room-based filtering)
- Large diagrams may impact browser performance

### User Experience Goals
- **Intuitive**: Natural language → visual diagrams
- **Fast**: Real-time drawing without delays
- **Smart**: Understands context and relationships
- **Persistent**: Never lose work across sessions

### Technical Decisions
- **LangGraph**: Chosen for complex agent state management
- **Excalidraw**: Provides rich drawing capabilities with good UX
- **WebSocket**: Real-time collaboration requirement
- **Next.js**: Full-stack TypeScript for rapid development
