## Known Issues

### 🔄 Issues Being Addressed
1. **Spatial Positioning Enhancement**: 
   - Implemented 4x4 grid region analysis
   - Added region-based positioning with occupancy mapping
   - Enhanced spatial intelligence for layout understanding

2. **Arrow Connectivity System**:
   - Added connection opportunity detection
   - Implemented spatial relationship analysis
   - Agent now prioritizes creating meaningful arrows between elements

### 🔄 Technical Debt
- Canvas state sync could be more efficient
- WebSocket error handling needs improvement
- Memory management for large canvases

---

## Architecture

### Frontend (`src/app/draw/page.tsx`)
- React-based chat interface with Excalidraw canvas
- Real-time canvas state tracking via `handleCanvasStateUpdate`
- Server-sent events for streaming agent responses

### Backend Agent (`src/lib/drawing/agent.ts`)
- LangGraph state machine for conversation flow
- Context-aware canvas analysis and description
- Smart positioning integration with Excalidraw tools

### Drawing Tools (`src/lib/drawing/excalidrawTool.ts`)
- Comprehensive shape and diagram creation
- Smart positioning algorithm with grid-based collision detection
- Complex diagram generators (flowcharts, mind maps)

### WebSocket Server (`src/app/api/draw/ws/route.ts`)
- Real-time drawing broadcast to all connected clients
- Canvas state persistence and synchronization
- RESTful API for drawing operations

---

## Key Features

### ✅ Working Features
- **Real-time Collaboration**: Multiple users can see drawings simultaneously
- **Persistent Sessions**: Drawings saved and restored across browser sessions
- **Context Awareness**: Agent remembers conversation history and canvas state
- **Multi-format Support**: Shapes, text, flowcharts, mind maps, diagrams
- **Streaming Responses**: Real-time agent thinking and drawing process
- **Voice Narration**: OpenAI TTS with multiple voices and auto-speak functionality
- **Smart Arrow Connections**: Intelligent element-to-element connections with optimal positioning

### 🔧 Features in Development
- **Canvas Analysis**: Enhanced ability to describe and analyze user-drawn content
- **Advanced Voice Modes**: Context-aware voice personas and emotional expression
- **Multi-language Support**: TTS in different languages for global accessibility

## Next Steps

### Immediate (This Session)
1. Fix spatial positioning to prevent element overlap
2. Implement intelligent arrow connections between elements
3. Improve canvas spatial awareness algorithms

### Short Term (Next 1-2 Sessions)
1. Add canvas analysis feature for user-drawn content
2. Implement advanced diagram layouts (org charts, network diagrams)
3. Add drag-and-drop positioning hints

### Medium Term (Future Development)
1. Multi-language diagram support
2. Export capabilities (PNG, SVG, PDF)
3. Template library for common diagram types
4. Collaborative editing with user cursors

## Development Notes

### Performance Considerations
- Canvas state sync happens on every change (could be optimized)
- WebSocket broadcasts to all clients (could add room-based filtering)
- Large diagrams may impact browser performance

### User Experience Goals
- **Intuitive**: Natural language → visual diagrams
- **Fast**: Real-time drawing without delays
- **Smart**: Understands context and relationships
- **Persistent**: Never lose work across sessions

### Technical Decisions
- **LangGraph**: Chosen for complex agent state management
- **Excalidraw**: Provides rich drawing capabilities with good UX
- **WebSocket**: Real-time collaboration requirement
- **Next.js**: Full-stack TypeScript for rapid development
